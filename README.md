## 1. Data source
The data was obtained from a public database from a study of Genome assembly of Pseudomonas aeruginosa YK01 using hybrid assembly of long and short reads. The data comprises of  single-end long reads and short paired-end reads sequenced with  Nanopore MinION sequencer Mk1B and  Illumina NextSeq 500 platform respectively. The subsamples are stored in Data/ which were used as inputs for the assembly workflow.
